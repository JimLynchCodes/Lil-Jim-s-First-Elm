# Lil Jim's First Elm Project
First elm project

# Finally Elmin'
Although I've had numerous colleagues who have said good things about Elm (*cough cough, Mark ðŸ˜„*), I haven't ever scaffolded my own Elm project until today! I had to install Elm in order to do the exercises in the Exercism.io Elm track, and after I ran the mac installer the last screen suggested that I run these commands:

```
elm init
elm make src/Main.elm --optimize
elm repl
```

and the rest is history...
